Kids upload and browse **gameplay screenshots** with captions; retro gallery with pixel frames.

**UI Reference:** Copy `specs/ui-reference/design.png` exactly. Dark red (`#7A001C` ~ `#98002E`) + neon pink (`#FF2E79`),
pixel-art accents, high contrast, retro scanline overlays where applicable. Rounded 8px radii, 2px neon outlines on focus.
